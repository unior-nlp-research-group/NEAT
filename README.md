# NEAT - Named Entities in Archeological Texts
Repository for NEAT, a database for ML created for domain-specific NER and other similar downstream tasks.

This dataset was created by extracting unstructured textual descriptions for items from the Europeana Collection, which are then annoted through several phases:
*  Terminology Integration
*  Semantic Projection
*  Semantic Expansion
*  Entity Evaluation
