# NEAT - Named Entity recognition in Archeological Texts

In this document, we propose a pipeline to develop NEAT, a dataset for named entity recognition in archaeological texts based on Europeanaâ€™s data collections. Our approach relies on a three-step procedure, which includes a semantic projection and the integration of domain terminologies and thesauri. As proof-of-concept, we test the methodology on a small set of data.
